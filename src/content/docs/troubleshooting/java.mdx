Sometimes you can have issues at the first hurdle, getting your server to boot. Some of these issues are to do with your Java deployment and we will cover some quick fixes to get you up and running.


### Wrong version of Java installed

When it comes to the 'wrong version installed' there's a two main factors to consider.
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Architecture (x86 or x64 or ARM etc)</li>
    <li>JDK version</li>
</ul>

Different Minecraft versions and plugins require different JDK versions.

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Minecraft 1.20.5 and above require Java 21+ to run correctly</li>
    <li>Minecraft 1.17 and above require Java 17+ to run correctly</li>
    <li>Minecraft 1.16 mods may require Java 8 to run correctly, but Vanilla will run on Java 17+</li>
    <li>Minecraft 1.15 and below requires Java 8 to run correctly</li>
</ul>

You can identify if you're having issues due to the Java architecture by executing `java --version` or `javac`. Running x64 Java on 64-bit OS is highly recommended as x32 versions have many limitations such as having a 4GB memory limit.

### Missing PATH variable

Depending on the OS you're running there are multiple ways to set the ENV / PATH location to call upon the java executable.

#### Windows 

If you're on windows this can be done entirely via the UI however some steps maybe slightly different depending on your Windows release. Below are steps based on Windows 11.
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Navigate to `C:\Program Files\Java` and identify the JDK version folder name e.g. `jdk-19`</li>
    <li>Open the bin folder within the JDK folder and copy the full folder path from file explorer</li>
    <li>Select the Windows icon open the start menu and go to 'Settings'</li>
    <li>Select the 'System' tab on the left hand side and go to the 'About' menu</li>
    <li>Open 'Advanced System Settings'</li>
    <li>Select the 'Advanced' tab</li>
    <li>Select 'Environment Variables'</li>
    <li>Under 'System Variables' scroll down until you see 'Path'</li>
    <li>Select 'Edit'</li>
    <li>Now select 'New' and paste in the file explorer path you copied earlier</li>
    <li>Press 'OK' to save changes</li>
</ul>

You can verify the above steps have worked as expected by running the following command in a command prompt window.

`java --version` or `javac`

#### MacOS

If you're running MacOS there's two different commands you could possibly run, the first (bash) is more for older devices and the latter (zsh) is for anything running Catalina or newer.

##### Bash Command 

```bash
...

echo export "JAVA_HOME=\$(/usr/libexec/java_home)" >> ~/.bash_profile
exec bash -l

...
```

##### ZSH Command

```bash
...

echo export "JAVA_HOME=\$(/usr/libexec/java_home)" >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh -l

...
```
